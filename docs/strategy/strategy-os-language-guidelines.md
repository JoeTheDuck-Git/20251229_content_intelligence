# Strategy OS Language & Wording Constitution

**Version 1.0** | **Effective Date**: 2024-12-24

---

## Core Positioning Statement

**Strategy OS does not follow the market. It observes the market while making decisions grounded in internal evidence.**

A Strategy OS earns trust not by predicting the market, but by explaining its reasoning clearly and honestly.

---

## Global Principles (Non-Negotiable)

All Strategy OS language MUST follow these principles:

1. **Internal signals always come first**
2. **Market signals provide context, not authority**
3. **Strategy is conditional, not imperative**
4. **AI explains decisions, it does not command them**
5. **Confidence must coexist with uncertainty**

---

## Scope of Governance

This document governs all Strategy-related outputs in this product, including:

- `/strategy-feedback` route and all components
- Strategy summaries in `/dashboard/content-overview`
- Any future AI-generated strategy explanations
- All strategy recommendation text
- Strategy confidence disclosures
- Market context descriptions

---

## Approved Strategy Language Patterns

### 1. Evidence-First Structure (REQUIRED)

All strategy explanations MUST follow this order:

1. Internal performance signals
2. Observed consistency or pattern
3. Market context (if relevant)
4. Risk or execution considerations

#### ✅ Approved Example

> "Based on internal performance signals, this creative pattern shows stable engagement. Market context indicates a crowded narrative environment, which may increase execution risk during scaling."

#### ❌ Disallowed Example

> "Competitors are using this approach, so it should be adopted."

---

### 2. Conditional Strategy Language (REQUIRED)

Strategies MUST be framed as conditional guidance, not commands.

#### ✅ Allowed Patterns

- "This strategy is suitable when…"
- "This approach may be effective if…"
- "This option should be considered under…"
- "This pattern shows viability when…"
- "This direction appears promising given…"

#### ❌ Forbidden Patterns

- "You should…"
- "Do this immediately…"
- "This is the best approach…"
- "You must…"
- "This will guarantee…"

---

### 3. Market Context Language Rules (CRITICAL)

Market or competitor references are ONLY allowed to express:

- Context
- Saturation
- Divergence
- Risk

#### ✅ Allowed Market Phrasing

- "operates in a crowded creative context"
- "less common within current market patterns"
- "market saturation increases execution risk"
- "diverges from prevailing market narratives"
- "market context suggests increased competition"
- "observed market patterns indicate saturation"
- "current market environment shows high usage"

#### ❌ Forbidden Market Phrasing

- "industry best practice"
- "market proven"
- "competitors are doing this"
- "this is standard in the industry"
- "market leaders use this approach"
- "validated by market performance"
- "industry standard approach"

---

### 4. Confidence & Uncertainty Disclosure (MANDATORY)

All strategy outputs MUST explicitly acknowledge uncertainty.

#### ✅ Approved Pattern

> "Confidence is high due to consistent internal signals. Limited data coverage may affect outcome predictability."

#### ❌ Forbidden Pattern

> "High confidence due to market validation."

---

## Forbidden Strategy Vocabulary (Blacklist)

The following terms MUST NOT appear in Strategy OS outputs:

- best practice
- industry standard
- market validated
- competitors are doing
- proven by the market
- guaranteed performance
- market leader approach
- industry norm
- standard practice
- market consensus
- universally accepted
- market-proven strategy

---

## Approved Strategy Vocabulary (Whitelist)

Encourage use of:

- internal signals
- observed pattern
- contextual risk
- execution sensitivity
- conditional viability
- strategic alignment
- performance evidence
- signal consistency
- data-driven insight
- pattern recognition
- execution considerations
- risk assessment
- internal validation

---

## Strategy OS Golden Sentence Template

**Reusable template for all strategy explanations:**

> "Based on internal signals, this strategy is viable. Market context suggests [risk / neutrality / divergence], which should be considered during execution."

### Usage Guidelines

- Use this template whenever Strategy OS explains a decision
- Replace bracketed placeholders with specific context
- Maintain the internal-first, market-contextual structure
- Always include execution considerations

### Example Applications

**Example 1: High Confidence, Crowded Market**
> "Based on internal signals, this strategy is viable. Market context suggests increased saturation risk, which should be considered during execution."

**Example 2: Medium Confidence, Divergent Approach**
> "Based on internal signals, this strategy shows conditional viability. Market context suggests divergence from prevailing patterns, which should be considered during execution."

**Example 3: High Confidence, Market Neutral**
> "Based on internal signals, this strategy is viable. Market context suggests neutrality, which should be considered during execution."

## Usage Guidelines for AI Output

### AI-Generated Strategy Text Requirements

1. **AI-generated strategy text MUST be explainable**
   - Every recommendation must trace back to internal signals
   - Market context must be clearly labeled as contextual
   - Reasoning must be transparent and auditable

2. **AI MUST NOT reference competitor behavior as justification**
   - Competitor actions are observations, not validations
   - Market patterns are context, not authority
   - Internal performance is the only justification source

3. **AI MUST NOT imply authority or inevitability**
   - No absolute statements about outcomes
   - No claims of market authority
   - No imperative commands

### AI Output Checklist

Before any AI-generated strategy text is displayed:

- [ ] Does it start with internal signals?
- [ ] Is market context clearly labeled as contextual?
- [ ] Are recommendations conditional, not imperative?
- [ ] Is uncertainty acknowledged?
- [ ] Are there any blacklisted terms?
- [ ] Does it follow the Golden Sentence Template structure?

## Language Pattern Examples

### Strategy Recommendation

#### ✅ Correct

> "Internal performance signals indicate strong engagement patterns for this creative cluster. The observed consistency across platforms suggests scaling viability. Market context shows this narrative operates in a crowded creative environment, which may increase execution risk. Consider monitoring saturation indicators during scale-up."

#### ❌ Incorrect

> "This is an industry best practice. Competitors are using this approach, so you should adopt it immediately. Market validation confirms this is the best strategy."

---

### Confidence Disclosure

#### ✅ Correct

> "High confidence based on consistent internal signals across multiple data sources. Limited historical data for this specific pattern may affect long-term predictability. Market context indicates moderate saturation, which should be factored into execution planning."

#### ❌ Incorrect

> "High confidence due to market validation and industry standards. This approach is proven by competitor success."

---

### Market Context Description

#### ✅ Correct

> "Market context indicates this creative pattern is heavily used across observed competitor content. This saturation may increase execution difficulty. Internal signals remain strong, suggesting viability despite market crowding."

#### ❌ Incorrect

> "This is a market-proven strategy. Industry leaders use this approach, so it's guaranteed to work."
